Bloom filters have nothing to do with flowers (despite the blog emoji ðŸ¥¸). It was conceived by Burton howard Bloom. This is a _Space-efficient probablistic data structure_. In Bloom filter false positives are very much possible, but false-negatives are not possible (i.e.) a query either returns, "possibly in set" or "definitely not". So, when a bloom filter returns "no" you can believe it, if it returns "maybe" you cannot. And it is very very efficient.

For example in a DB, if we want to check whether a data is present, instead of making a full db check we could use bloom filter as a preliminary test to verify whether some data _could_ be in the database

A simple example of a bloom filter would be:

{{% code file="/tech/algos/bloom.go" language="go" %}}



This is used in [chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/blink/+/refs/heads/main/Source/wtf/BloomFilter.h) to check for malicious sites.
