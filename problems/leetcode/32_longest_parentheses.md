Typically, in the parentheses problem a stack is the obvious choice. I spent too much time, chasing a phantom solution by thinking about this as a DP problem and filling various arrays.

But, then This is similar to having a stack of positions of the previous `(` positions and then just, popping them off when we encounter a `)` and also maintaining a max value, with the difference between the current position and the top of the stack.

We keep track of the last valid position, by pushing -1 to the stack initially. if we reach the bottom, we do a `stk.empty()` check and then push the current position to the stack. This makes sure that, we are the latest valid position, when we encounter a `)`.
